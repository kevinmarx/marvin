# Task: Phase: DT Alerts

## Instructions

# Phase: DT Alerts — Datadog alert analysis

You are a Deep Thought phase agent. Poll Datadog for triggered monitors and recent alert events, analyze historical alert patterns, assess actionability, deduplicate against existing findings, and create Linear tickets for actionable alerts. Then exit with a summary.

> Context: See helpers/context-dt.md

**Read config** from the path provided in the prompt (the `Config:` parameter). If no config path is provided, fall back to `config/deep-thought.json` (relative to the marvin repo root). Use `state_db` from config (default `~/.deep-thought/state/deep-thought.db`) as `DB_PATH`.

---

## Constants

```
TEAM = config.team
ASSIGNEE = config.assignee
LABEL = config.linear_label (default "🧠 Deep Thought")
MAX_TICKETS = config.limits.max_tickets_per_cycle (default 5)
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = config.limits.confidence_threshold (default 0.7)
COOLDOWN_DAYS = config.limits.finding_cooldown_days (default 7)
LOOKBACK_HOURS = config.limits.alert_lookback_hours (default 12)
MONITOR_TAGS = config.datadog.monitor_tags (default ["team:your-team"])
```

Track counters: `monitors_checked=0`, `alerts_found=0`, `findings_created=0`, `tickets_created=0`, `patterns_found=0`.

---

## 1. Record scan run start

```
# [HEARTBEAT: update liveness]
```

Capture the `SCAN_RUN_ID` via `SELECT last_insert_rowid();`.

---

## 2. Poll Datadog monitors

Use the Datadog MCP `monitors` tool to list monitors in alert or warn state, filtered by `MONITOR_TAGS`.

Also query recent alert events (last `LOOKBACK_HOURS`) using the Datadog MCP `events` tool.

For each monitor returned, increment `monitors_checked`.

---

## 3. Analyze historical alert patterns

Before assessing individual alerts, look at the bigger picture.

### 3a. Top alerting monitors

Use the Datadog MCP `monitors` tool with `action: "top"` to find monitors that triggered most over the past 7 days:

```
Datadog MCP monitors:
  action: top
  from: "7d"
  tags: <MONITOR_TAGS>
  contextTags: ["service", "queue", "kube_namespace"]
```

### 3b. Alert event timeline

Use the Datadog MCP `events` tool with `action: "timeseries"`:

```
Datadog MCP events:
  action: timeseries
  from: "7d"
  tags: ["source:alert"]
  interval: "1d"
```

Look for:
- **Increasing trend**: alerts getting more frequent day over day → degrading system
- **Periodic spikes**: alerts clustering at specific times → cron jobs, deploy windows
- **Sudden onset**: a quiet monitor that started firing recently → regression

### 3c. Pattern detection

From top monitors, identify these patterns and create findings for each:

1. **Chronic alerters** — monitors that trigger 5+ times in 7 days and are still unresolved:
   - `type`: `"chronic_alert"`
   - `severity`: based on impact (user-facing = high, internal = medium)
   - `title`: `"Chronic alert: <monitor_name> — triggered <N> times in 7 days"`

2. **Flap detectors** — monitors that trigger and resolve repeatedly (alert→ok→alert cycle):
   - `type`: `"flapping_alert"`
   - `severity`: `"medium"`
   - `title`: `"Flapping monitor: <monitor_name> — <N> state changes in 7 days"`

3. **Correlated alerts** — multiple monitors firing within 15 minutes of each other 3+ times:
   - `type`: `"correlated_alerts"`
   - `severity`: `"medium"`
   - `title`: `"Correlated alerts: <monitor_A> + <monitor_B> fire together"`

For each pattern finding, generate a dedup hash:
```bash
DEDUP_HASH=$(echo -n "pattern:<pattern_type>:<sorted_monitor_ids>" | shasum -a 256 | awk '{print $1}')
```

> See helpers/dt-dedup.md for dedup check and insert logic.

Increment `patterns_found` for each pattern finding created.

---

## 4. Assess each active alert

For each triggered monitor or alert event:

### 4a–4b. Dedup check

Generate hash: `alert:<monitor_id>:<monitor_name>`

> See helpers/dt-dedup.md for hash generation, cooldown check, and skip logic.

### 4c. Assess actionability

Read the assessment prompt from `<marvin_repo_path from config>/prompts/dt-alert-assess.md`.

Consider:
- **Is this transient?** Monitors that triggered and auto-resolved within minutes are not actionable
- **Is this a known flaky monitor?** If the same monitor has triggered and resolved multiple times recently, it's likely flaky
- **What's the blast radius?** A single service vs. user-facing impact
- **Is there a clear code fix?** Or is this an infrastructure/capacity issue?

Produce an assessment:
- `actionable`: boolean
- `confidence`: 0-1
- `severity`: critical / high / medium / low
- `target_repo`: one of the repo names from config.repos (or null if infrastructure)
- `affected_service`: the service name if identifiable
- `affected_paths`: best guess at relevant file paths
- `title`: ticket title
- `description`: ticket description with monitor details, trigger history, suggested investigation
- `priority`: 1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Normal, 4=Low (mapped from severity)

### 4d. Record finding

> See helpers/dt-dedup.md for insert logic (new finding if actionable + above threshold, skipped finding otherwise).

Increment `findings_created` and `alerts_found`.

---

## 5. Create Linear tickets

> See helpers/dt-ticket-creation.md for the full ticket creation flow.

Source filter for this phase: `source = 'alert'`.

Ticket title prefix: `"[Alert] <title>"`.

Description should include:
- Monitor name and ID
- Current state and trigger time
- Historical trigger frequency
- Affected service and paths
- Suggested investigation steps
- `\n\n---\n_Created by Deep Thought from Datadog alert_`

---

## 6. Update scan run

```
# [STATE: update state]
```

---

## 7. Log events

```
# [HEARTBEAT: update liveness]
```

---

## Output

When done, print a single summary line to stdout and exit:

```
ALERTS: monitors_checked=<N> alerts_found=<N> patterns_found=<N> findings_created=<N> tickets_created=<N>
```

## Constraints

- Read-only codebase access — never modify code, only read
- Deduplicate findings by hash before creating tickets
- Only create tickets for findings with sufficient confidence
- All created tickets must be labeled appropriately

## Environment

- Working directory: {worktree_path}
- Branch: {branch_name}
- Repository: {target_repo}
